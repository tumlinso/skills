# CORE4 host resource policy v1

The host database coordinates physical ownership only. Todo tasks, claims,
evidence, and retry state remain project-local todo-orchestrator authority.

The fixed priority order, highest first, is `clean_cuda_foreground`,
`active_local_delegation`, `foreground_gpu`, `background_cuda`, and
`idle_model_residency`. A requester may signal preemption only to conflicting,
preemptible owners below it. Equal or higher owners are never displaced.

Selection examines runtime resource IDs and topology tags. It first chooses a
free compatible bundle; therefore an available spare island does not disturb a
resident service. No GPU index or cabling layout is part of this contract.

Service owners use `reserve_service`, `set_priority`, `heartbeat`,
`preempt_requested`, and `release`. Preemption is cooperative: the owner drains,
evicts, and releases physical resources. Stale dead processes are swept without
altering project task state. Existing background and foreground APIs remain
supported; CUDA clean-foreground callers opt into the highest named class.
